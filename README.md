# RecoMovie
 A movie recommendation app using react native, the app recommends movies to the user via a Content-Based Recommendation system that recommends movies similar to the movie the user loves.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to register a free account on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to obtain a developer key.
The details of the movies(title, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using that API.
